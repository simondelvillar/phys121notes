# UBCO PHYS 121 Notes
Hey there!
This is where I keep **all my physics lecture notes** in one place. The goal is simple:
> If you ever miss a class, you can just open a single link and see the **latest, complete, and organized** notes with illustrations!

All notes come from a file called `main.tex` that I update every lecture. This is just the code used to make the PDF file that is easily viewable.

Most of the content on here is from the in-class lecture. Based on the class notes of Jake Bobowski.


## What's in here?
- **`main.tex`** -- The LaTeX source file 
- The compiled PDF is automatically deployed so you can view it online.
- **Automatic updates** -- Every time I add/change something after a lecture, the site updates itself.
- **Recent updates section** -- keeps track of changes I make and organizes it into class days

## Live site
You can always check the most recent notes here: 
https://simondelvillar.github.io/phys121notes/
Just open it in any browser, on a computer or phone, and the PDF will fill the page.

## How I update the notes
Here's what happens after every lecture:
1. I open `main.tex` and add the new material from the class. 
2. I push the changes to Github.
3. Github compiles the `.tex` file
4. The PDF is published online

## For my classmates/anyone taking this in the future 
Feel free to: 
- bookmark the site
- share with anyone who missed class
- use it as a reference while studying
## 📝 Slides vs Master Notes

To be honest, most of the content in these notes comes from Jake Bobowski's **iPad notes**.  

However, these notes are **much more convenient and readable** than the slides alone. Why?  

- Everything is compiled into **one continuous PDF** — no jumping between separate slide files  
- The PDF keeps everything **organized and easy to read**  
- Includes extra formatting, a **table of contents**, and **bookmarks** for easy navigation  
- Easy to search, scroll, and print for studying.
